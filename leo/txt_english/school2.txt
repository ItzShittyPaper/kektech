hi
/0# JA
ok ktosiek, what do you have here that's so important.
/3# JALAPENO
this little thing right here *shows me a key*
/0# JA
what? it's a fucking key
/2# FLORYDA
this is THE key to the school's underground warehouse
/0# JA
aaand where did you find it? (this doesn't look good...)
/3# JALAPENO
the janitor just left it on a desk, so we took it "just in case"
/0# JA
aaand now you want me to go there with you, yeah?
/2# FLORYDA
yeah, why not? *the bell rings*
okay, the break is over. but don't go to class now-
/1# KTOSIEK
huh?
/2# FLORYDA
let's go there now with donix. just wait for me since we'll have to bring our stuff with us.
*pulls books out of a backpack, packing them on the windowsill so that no one takes them*
can someone write to askel? it would be nice if someone would do that crap. but fuck it, he's probably not coming anyway.

we go in, then make a plan of this place, and in the end we steal everything we can, I don't think such an opportunity will happen to us, so yeah.
does anyone have any questions, or is stressed?
/3# JALAPENO
Not going to lie this is kind of a fucked up plan, but i think we'll do it.
after we do it lets go to my place, we'll play some doom 2. i have a special WAD for you that i worked on.
/2# FLORYDA
great idea, we'll unpack there and plan our next move. in short these will be our best truancy that we'll ever go on.
well donix, I guess I didn't leave you much choice here but...
/0# JA
yeah?
/2# FLORYDA
