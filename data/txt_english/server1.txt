i know that its a shitty situation because we only have like 2 hour, but you know, a movie marathon has to be perfect. we just have to sort the cables and install the tv, we'll space the chairs later

what is going on here?
/0# RURY
sadly i have to announce that your movie marathong wont work, because we have a more important project.
to be exact we're starting a simulation test of the "balkanica" project. the equipment is one hundred percent set and ready. this time the cooling works and it wont blow up
/3# OTIS I JA
blow up?
/0# RURY
chill out, nothing really happened. i installed debian on there so you can start the work. i know shit about linux, you eggheads should start working on it.
mysterious cat, you better start working on the projects safety, nothing here can see the daylight, you guys understand?
otis, good luck setting up this deboma or whatever its called. and you donix, well. you're going into the simulation.
/2# JA
you're joking right?
why me in the first place huh?
/0# RURY
you're going, period. im not going to discuss it with you. you're going to be the first person that'll go to history, going into a simulated world. your task is to test everything. every person has to behave like a human, and the world should not be different from the one that we live in.

let me know if something is very wrong.
See you later, and I'll see you in the evening. You only have less than a day and the clock is ticking.
