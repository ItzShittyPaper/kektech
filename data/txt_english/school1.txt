now it's the time to go through the stairs...
school stair were always a nightmare for me. every single hour you had to go like 3 floors up or down, and the stairs were always crowded so it took ages to get through.
these stairs always have their own rules, different in every school.
i kinda miss that stuff, but anyways.
